# GraphQL operations for AI-guided assessment flow
#
# This file is kept for legacy organization but operations are now
# consolidated in graphql/queries/ and graphql/mutations/ directories
# as per Architecture document structure.
#
# See:
# - graphql/queries/GetOnboardingSession.graphql for assessment state
# - graphql/mutations/SubmitAssessmentMessage.graphql for message submission
# - graphql/mutations/CompleteAssessment.graphql for summary generation
# - graphql/mutations/ConfirmAssessmentSummary.graphql for confirmation
# - graphql/mutations/ResetAssessment.graphql for starting over
